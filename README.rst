Alexander Puckhaber's Fluid Simulation Thesis Project
-----------------------------------------------------

# Fork of PySPH project: https://github.com/pypr/pysph

## Goals
- Simulate diffusion of solutes through solvents by modifying PySPH
- Use the Volume Fraction method to simulate multiple different materials in the same particle
- Attempt to store diffusion and other properties of the materials in a data structure (ex. heat changing diffusion speed, possibly reactions)
- Maybe attempt to use Adaptive Resolution method or similar to precipitate solids and form gases
